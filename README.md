# Description
Bloop, is a sci-fi dystopia set in an unground bunker lab. Alien slimes have invaded Earth and consume everything that is not them. Scientists have captured one, they nicknamed Bloop, and successfully re-programmed it to consume only its own kind. But something happened before they could release Bloop. Years later, Bloop escapes on its own. But Bloop is no longer quite what it seems.

Enter Bloop Level 0. Play through several levels to learn the mechanics and test the prototype.
